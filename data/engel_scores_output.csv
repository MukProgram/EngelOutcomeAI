These seizures were previously rare but have increased in frequency over the past year to 2-3 times per week. This pattern fits the IIA criteria of 'Initially free of disabling seizures but has rare seizures now.' While not explicitly stated, it is implied that these focal seizures are likely impairing functioning to some degree if requiring medication, meeting the 'disabling' qualification. An argument could potentially be made for a Class I score since seizure frequency and nature is not fully clear over the entire post-operative or follow-up period, but Class IIA is the best fit based on the details provided."

This frequency would still be considered 'rare' based on the Engel criteria definitions.

While the seizure frequency is not explicitly stated since restarting medication, there is no indication that the patient is completely seizure-free. He continues to have staring episodes where he loses awareness, which are likely focal impaired awareness seizures. Given that these seizures result in impairment/disability, they qualify as 'disabling seizures'. Since he restarted the lamotrigine, the frequency is implied to be less than the previous twice per month.

However, she did have a cluster of seizures in February/March this year, indicating that she is no longer completely seizure-free. This fits the IIA criteria of 'Initially free of disabling seizures but has rare seizures now.' While the frequency of seizures is not explicitly stated, the use of 'cluster' suggests they are still rare rather than frequent. There is no evidence to support a higher or lower score."

An Engel score of IB corresponds to 'Non disabling simple partial seizures only since surgery'. Although it is not specified whether these seizures are simple partial, the lack of mention of disabling seizures matches the IB criteria. The seizures are also described as infrequent, rather than rare, which fits better with IB than IIA or IIB. Therefore, I have assigned a score of IB based on the available information."
