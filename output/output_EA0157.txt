Based on the information provided, I would assign this patient an Engel score of:

Engel Score: IIB

Explanation:
The patient is described as having between 3-4 seizures per week currently. This frequency of disabling seizures would fall under Class II in the Engel scale, which is defined as "Rare disabling seizures" or being "almost seizure-free." 

Specifically, the IIB category seems most applicable here, which is defined as "Rare disabling seizures since surgery." Even though the patient has not undergone surgery, she seems to meet the criteria of having rare/infrequent disabling seizures at her current estimated frequency of 3-4 seizures per week. This is on the higher end of "rare" but still appears to qualify based on the information provided.

The other Engel categories do not appear to accurately capture the patient's current seizure frequency. She has more than rare disabling seizures, ruling out Class I. She also does not have seizure-free intervals comprising over half the follow-up period, ruling out Class III. And she has had more than just a minor reduction in seizures, ruling out Class IV. 

Therefore, Class IIB appears to be the best fit for this patient's seizure frequency of 3-4 disabling seizures per week based on applying the Engel criteria to the details available in this clinical note. Please let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
