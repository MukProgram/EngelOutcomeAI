Engel Score: IIB

Explanation: Based on the information provided in the clinical note, the patient is experiencing rare disabling seizures since starting medication, as she is having absence seizures around once per week. These absence seizures are described as events where "she pauses her task and her head turns to one side and she will stare vacantly", which would be considered disabling, even if only brief. She is also still getting some generalised tonic-clonic seizures, though very infrequently (the last one was 3 years ago). Since she has rare disabling seizures that have continued since starting medication, I have assigned an Engel score of IIB. I did not assign IA since she is not completely seizure-free, IB because the seizures are disabling, IC because she has not had a period of at least 2 years free of disabling seizures, ID because there is no mention of seizures only occurring with medication withdrawal, IIA because she did not have an initial period free of seizures, IIC because she has not had a 2-year period of rare seizures, and IID because the seizures are not nocturnal only. The other categories also do not apply. Please let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
