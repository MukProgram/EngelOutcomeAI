Engel Score: IIB

Explanation: Based on the clinical note, the patient has focal seizures with altered awareness approximately once every 2 weeks (fortnight) as well as rare focal to bilateral convulsive seizures, with the last convulsive seizure occurring around Christmas 2017. He has tried several antiepileptic drugs in the past and is currently taking eslicarbazepine and zonisamide. 

While the patient does still have some disabling seizures, they are described as rare (the last convulsive seizure was over a year ago). Therefore, this would be most consistent with an Engel score of IIB - "Rare disabling seizures since surgery." He is not completely seizure free, but the seizures are rare and he has gone over a year since his last convulsive seizure. The note also mentions he has had worthwhile reduction in seizures, going from around 2 convulsive seizures per year initially down to rare events currently. So while he may also partially fit the criteria for Class IIIA based on worthwhile seizure reduction, the rare disabling seizures description fits most closely with Engel IIB.
