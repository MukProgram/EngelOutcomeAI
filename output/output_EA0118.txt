Engel Score: ID

Explanation: Based on the information provided, the patient experienced one generalized convulsion that was possibly triggered by antiepileptic drug withdrawal. The clinical note states that the patient "has not had any further episodes since" the initial seizure in May. This aligns with the Engel ID criteria of "Generalized convulsions with antiepileptic drug withdrawal only." While there is no mention of the patient being on antiepileptic medication prior to this event, it does state that he had stopped taking benzodiazepines 2 days before, which likely triggered the seizure. So while not on typical antiepileptic drugs, the benzodiazepine withdrawal likely provoked this solitary seizure event. The lack of any further seizures and the potential provoking factor of drug withdrawal make the Engel ID classification most appropriate based on the details provided.
