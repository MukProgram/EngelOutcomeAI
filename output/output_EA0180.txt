Based on the information provided, I would assign this patient an Engel score of:

IA

Explanation:
The Engel scale is typically used to classify seizure outcomes after epilepsy surgery. However, the clinical note does not state that the patient underwent epilepsy surgery. It says the patient has a diagnosis of probable juvenile myoclonic epilepsy and is being treated with the anti-epileptic drug Epilim chrono (sodium valproate). 

The note states that the patient "remains seizure free" and that his "last seizure was November 2015." This indicates he has been completely seizure-free for over 2 years while on the Epilim medication.

Although the Engel scale is not ideally suited for rating medication outcomes, Class IA corresponds to "Completely seizure-free since surgery." This most closely matches the information provided indicating the patient has had no seizures for over 2 years on the Epilim, so I assigned a class IA score. However, without knowing the details of his seizure frequency prior to starting treatment, it is difficult to fully rate the efficacy of the medication using the Engel scale. The timescale of being seizure-free for at least 2 years lines up with a Class IA designation.
