Based on the information provided, I would assign this patient an Engel score of: 

IVB

Explanation:
The Engel Outcome Scale is typically used to classify seizure outcomes following epilepsy surgery. However, this patient has not undergone epilepsy surgery. The clinical note states that the patient continues to have seizures every week, describing them as "similar episodes" to his initial seizure that led to his epilepsy diagnosis. He has focal impaired awareness seizures where he feels "out of his body" and is unable to move, as well as focal to bilateral tonic-clonic seizures with complete loss of consciousness. 

While the Engel scale does not directly apply since the patient did not have surgery, his seizure frequency and lack of seizure control most closely resembles Class IVB - "No appreciable change" in seizure frequency from his baseline prior to hypothetical surgery. He continues to have weekly disabling seizures, so he would not meet criteria for Class I (seizure-free), Class II ("almost seizure-free"), or Class III ("worthwhile improvement").

In summary, I assigned a Class IVB Engel score to reflect the patient's ongoing weekly disabling seizures without appreciable improvement, but note the Engel scale itself does not directly apply here since the patient did not actually undergo epilepsy surgery.
