Engel Score: IIIA

Explanation: Based on the information provided, Rachel has generalized epilepsy with both absence seizures and tonic-clonic seizures. Prior to starting levetiracetam, she was having tonic-clonic seizures about every 2 months. After starting levetiracetam, the seizure frequency has improved, indicating a worthwhile seizure reduction though likely not seizure freedom. She continues to have absence seizures about weekly. Given that there has been a worthwhile seizure reduction but not freedom from disabling seizures, I have assigned an Engel score of IIIA. While the Engel scale is typically used to classify outcomes after epilepsy surgery, it still provides a reasonable framework to categorize the level of seizure control in this case. The lack of complete seizure freedom but presence of a worthwhile seizure reduction places Rachel in Engel Class IIIA based on the scale definitions provided.
