Engel Score: IA

Explanation:
Based on the clinical note, the patient is "Mr. Williams", a 48-year-old male with a history of temporal lobe epilepsy who underwent a right hippocampectomy in 2018. It is stated that he has remained seizure-free since the surgery in 2018. 

According to the Engel Outcome Scale criteria, Class I indicates being free of disabling seizures. Subcategory IA specifically refers to being "completely seizure-free since surgery". Since Mr. Williams has remained seizure-free since his 2018 surgery, he would be given a classification of IA on the Engel Outcome Scale. 

The note states "I was very pleased to note that he remains seizure free after his surgery", confirming that he has had no seizures of any kind since the procedure. It also mentions that before surgery he was having focal onset seizures several times per week despite medication trials. The lack of any seizures after surgery is most consistent with an Engel IA designation on the scale. Even though he is not explicitly stated to be "post-surgery", the timeline indicates he has been seizure-free since the 2018 surgery.

In summary, based on being completely seizure-free since his 2018 right hippocampectomy, Mr. Williams would be assigned an Engel score of IA.
