Engel Score: IIB

Explanation: Based on the information provided, the patient has rare disabling seizures since surgery. Specifically, it states that "This man has remained seizure free for three years and he had return to drive. However he had another seizure whilst he was asleep on the 2nd November." This indicates he was seizure free for 3 years after surgery, meeting the criteria for Engel Class IA. However, he then had a disabling seizure in November. Having a single disabling seizure after being seizure free for years meets the criteria for Engel IIB - rare disabling seizures since surgery. He is not completely seizure free (IA) but has had only one seizure so far (rare disabling seizure). So I have categorized him as Engel IIB.
