Engel Score: IB

Explanation: Based on the information provided, Hannah has experienced some non-disabling simple partial seizures since the onset of her seizures a few months ago. Specifically, the note states that she has had 4 generalized tonic-clonic seizures, all occurring during sleep. This fits the criteria for Engel class IB - "Non disabling simple partial seizures only since surgery." Although she has not had surgery, the instructions stated to ignore that aspect. The seizures are not disabling, as the note states she is doing well in school and there are no neurological deficits on exam. The recommendation is also to avoid provoking factors (sleep deprivation, illness) rather than necessarily starting medications, implying the seizures are not severely impairing at this point. In summary, Hannah meets criteria for Engel IB based on rare, non-disabling simple partial seizures only over the past few months. The physician suspects these may be related to Benign Rolandic Epilepsy, which carries a good prognosis. Please let me know if any part of my explanation needs clarification!
