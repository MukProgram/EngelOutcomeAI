Engel Score: IIB

Explanation: Based on the information provided, Mr. Harris continues to have rare disabling seizures since his surgery, occurring about once to twice per month. While not completely seizure-free, this level of seizure control would still be considered a worthwhile improvement. Specifically, the note states "His epilepsy is reasonably controlled" and that he gets "infrequent minor complex partial seizures maybe around once to twice per month." This frequency of disabling seizures fits the criteria for Engel score IIB ("Rare disabling seizures since surgery"). Increasing his medication further led to side effects, so his current regimen appears to provide the best seizure control possible for him at this time. The note does not provide enough information to determine if he has had prolonged seizure-free intervals or significant seizure reduction to qualify for a class III or IV score. Therefore, given he continues to have rare disabling seizures since his initial hemorrhage/epilepsy onset, the Engel score IIB most accurately captures his level of seizure control based on the details provided.
