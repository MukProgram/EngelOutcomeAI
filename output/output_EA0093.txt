Engel Score: IA

Explanation: Based on the information provided in the clinical note, I have assigned an Engel score of IA to this patient. The key information supporting an IA score is:

1) The note states "She has been very well and has had no seizures since Christmas 2015." This indicates the patient has been completely seizure-free for over 3 months.

2) There is no mention of any simple partial or disabling seizures occurring since Christmas 2015. 

3) The prolonged seizure freedom of over 3 months meets the IA criteria of "Completely seizure-free since surgery." While the patient did not actually undergo surgery, the criteria still applies to the seizure freedom timeframe.

In summary, the lack of any reported seizures over a period exceeding 3 months justifies an Engel score of IA, indicating the patient is completely seizure-free in the follow-up period. Please let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
