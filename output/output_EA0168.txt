Based on the information provided, I would assign this patient an Engel score of:

IA

Explanation:
The Engel scale is meant to classify outcomes after epilepsy surgery. However, the clinical note does not state that the patient underwent epilepsy surgery. It says the patient is on anti-epileptic medication (Epilim) for probable juvenile myoclonic epilepsy and has been seizure-free since November 2015. 

Despite the lack of surgery details, I assigned an Engel score of IA since that category signifies being "Completely seizure-free since surgery." This seemed most applicable given the patient has had no seizures since November 2015 while on medication. However, without knowing if the patient actually underwent resection surgery and the details around that, it is difficult to accurately classify them on the Engel scale. The note is also unclear on what type of seizures they previously had and when they started medication. More details would be needed to fully justify an Engel score. But based on the information stating no seizures since 2015 while on Epilim, IA appeared to be the best option.
