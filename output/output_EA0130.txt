Engel Score: IA

Explanation:
Based on the clinical note, Ms. Rhian Rutter has been completely seizure-free since at least 2005 when she was discharged from the epilepsy clinic. The note states "I am happy to say that there has not been any recurrence of seizures since we last saw her at the clinic." This aligns with an Engel score of IA, which is defined as "Completely seizure-free since surgery." Even though the patient did not have surgery, she has been completely seizure-free for over 15 years, which meets the criteria for IA. The note also mentions she might have occasional twitches when half asleep, but specifies these are not seizures. So I felt IA was the most appropriate score based on the prolonged seizure freedom. The other Engel scores did not accurately reflect her situation of complete seizure freedom for an extended period. Please let me know if you need any clarification or have a different interpretation!
