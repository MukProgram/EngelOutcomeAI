Engel Score: IIB

Explanation: Based on the information provided in the clinical note, the patient has not had any disabling generalized convulsions for at least 5 years, indicating good seizure control from antiepileptic medications. However, the note mentions that the patient has had "additional events" over the last few years where he feels vague and not himself, before returning to normal a few minutes later. These events happen a few times per year. 

While more information is needed to definitively categorize these events, they could potentially represent rare disabling seizures. The note mentions plans to get more data on these events through ambulatory blood pressure monitoring and patient videos. But based on the available information, the patient appears to fit the Engel class IIB criteria of "Rare disabling seizures since surgery." I chose this Engel score because there is evidence of good seizure control overall, but also a suggestion of rare ongoing disabling seizure-like events that need further characterization. As more data becomes available on the nature and frequency of these additional events, the Engel score could be reassessed. Please let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
