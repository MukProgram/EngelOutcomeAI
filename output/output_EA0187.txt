Engel Score: IVB

Explanation: Based on the information provided in the clinical note, there has been no appreciable change in the patient's seizure frequency or severity since increasing the levetiracetam dose. The note states that "since increasing the levetiracetam there has been no change in her seizure frequency. She has around 3-5 seizures a week." This fits the criteria for Class IVB on the Engel scale - "No appreciable change." 

While the provider discusses some potential medication changes and sleep recommendations to hopefully improve seizure control, there is no evidence of any actual improvement or worthwhile seizure reduction at this time. Without any noted improvement, a Class IVB designation of "No appreciable change" seems most appropriate based on the Engel criteria. The clinical reasoning is that the defining feature of Class IV is "No worthwhile improvement" which aligns with the documentation of no change in seizure frequency on the increased levetiracetam dose. Please let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
