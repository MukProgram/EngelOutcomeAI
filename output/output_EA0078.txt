Engel Score: IVB

Explanation: Based on the information provided in the clinical note, there is no clear evidence that the patient has experienced any worthwhile improvement or worsening of seizures after some intervention such as surgery. 

The note states that "Her seizures are reasonably controlled" which suggests some control but not complete freedom from seizures. There is no mention of specific details such as seizure frequency, severity, or duration that could be used to determine a more specific Engel class.

The only intervention mentioned is a planned medication change, but there is no follow up yet to determine the impact on seizures.

Therefore, class IVB - "No appreciable change" - seems most appropriate based on the limited information provided. There does not appear to be enough evidence to support assignment of any other more specific Engel class at this time. If more details emerge about the patient's seizure frequency and response to medication changes over time, the Engel classification could be reassessed.
