Engel Score: IC

Explanation:
Based on the information provided, the patient has a history of symptomatic structural focal epilepsy related to perinatal injury, with seizures starting at age 10. She has had about 6 lifetime seizures, all occurring during sleep. Her last seizure was 10 years ago. She is currently on lamotrigine 150mg twice daily and has been seizure-free for the past 10 years while on this medication. 

The Engel classification focuses on seizure outcomes following epilepsy surgery, but we can apply the criteria here. This patient has had some disabling seizures after the onset of her epilepsy, but has been free of disabling seizures for at least 2 years. This fits the criteria for Engel class IC - "Some disabling seizures after surgery, but free of disabling seizures for at least 2 years." 

Even though she has not had epilepsy surgery, her seizure control and outcome over the last 10 years mirrors what would be considered an Engel class IC outcome if she had undergone surgery. She previously had disabling seizures, but has now been free of disabling seizures for an extended period of time (10 years), meeting criteria for Engel class IC.
