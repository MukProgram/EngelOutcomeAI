Based on the information provided, I would assign this patient an Engel score of:

IA

Explanation:
The clinical note states that the patient "remains seizures free" and that his "last seizure was in February 2005." This indicates that the patient has been completely seizure-free for over 2 years since his last reported seizure date. 

The Engel scale defines Class IA as "Completely seizure-free since surgery." Although it is not specified if the patient underwent surgery, the criteria of being completely seizure-free for over 2 years still matches the IA classification. 

None of the other Engel classifications accurately capture the patient's seizure status as described in the clinical note. Class IA is the best fit based on the information stating the patient remains seizure-free and has not had any seizures since February 2005, indicating complete seizure freedom for over 2 years.
