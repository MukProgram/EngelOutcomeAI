Engel Score: IVB

Explanation: Based on the information provided in the clinical note, the patient has temporal lobe epilepsy and is currently taking multiple anti-epileptic medications, including carbamazepine, zonisamide, omeprazole, and thyroxine. It is mentioned that despite medication adjustments, the patient continues to have seizures, including 4 more attacks since the last appointment. One of these seizures resulted in injury requiring stitches. 

The clinician decided to switch the carbamazepine to eslicarbazepine due to side effects, but no surgery or definitive treatment is mentioned. Overall, there is no indication that the patient's seizures have significantly reduced or improved. Rather, it seems there has been no appreciable change in seizure control despite medication adjustments. 

Therefore, based on the Engel criteria provided, this patient would be best classified as Class IVB - "No appreciable change" in seizure control. There may have been some attempts at seizure reduction through medication changes, but not enough information is provided to categorize the patient as Class IVA ("Significant seizure reduction"). The overall clinical picture presented is one of continued uncontrolled seizures without worthwhile improvement, meeting criteria for assignment of Engel score IVB. Please let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
