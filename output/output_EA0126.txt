Engel Score: IIIC

Explanation: Based on the clinical note, Mr. Joyce has focal epilepsy secondary to tuberous sclerosis. He experiences focal frontal lobe seizures with stiffening/posturing about 4-5 times per month. He also has a history of focal to bilateral convulsive seizures, but these have not occurred for several years. The note states that his epilepsy seems "fairly stable at the moment."

While Mr. Joyce does still experience monthly focal seizures, these do not seem to significantly impact his functioning, as he is able to live independently and maintain a job. He has also gone several years without his more severe seizure type. This represents a worthwhile improvement in seizure control (Class III), though not to the point of being almost seizure-free (Class II). 

Specifically, subclass IIIC fits best - "More than rare disabling seizures after surgery, but rare seizures for at least 2 years." In this case, surgery is not applicable, but the description of having more than rare disabling seizures, yet going at least 2 years without his more severe seizure type, matches the essence of subclass IIIC.

In summary, Mr. Joyce's seizure frequency and type represent a worthwhile improvement in control, though not to the point of being nearly seizure-free. Subclass IIIC of the Engel scale best captures his current level of improvement. Please let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
