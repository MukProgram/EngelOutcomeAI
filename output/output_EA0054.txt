Engel Score: IIA

Explanation: Based on the clinical note, the patient has focal seizures with altered awareness about once per week currently. He has a history of focal to bilateral convulsive seizures, but has not had one of those larger seizures for 3 years. This means he was initially free of disabling seizures after the focal to bilateral convulsive seizures stopped, but now has rare disabling focal seizures with altered awareness occurring about once per week. This fits the criteria for Engel score IIA ("Initially free of disabling seizures but has rare seizures now"). While the seizures are not necessarily post-surgical, the Engel scale still provides a standardized way to categorize the level of seizure control. The focal seizures with altered awareness are considered disabling given their weekly frequency. The note does not specify if he has had any seizure-free intervals of at least 2 years, so scores IIIB and IIIC do not apply currently. However, if the increased dose of lamotrigine leads to better seizure control, his Engel score could be updated in the future.
