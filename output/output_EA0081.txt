Engel Score: IVB

Explanation: Based on the information provided, Mr. Jones appears to have uncontrolled focal seizures with and without impaired awareness, as well as convulsive seizures. There is no evidence that his seizures have improved following any intervention or treatment. Therefore, I have assigned an Engel score of IVB - no appreciable change in seizures.

The key factors in my reasoning are:

1) Mr. Jones continues to have focal seizures with altered awareness (described as "difficult to describe feeling, similar to deja-vu"). 

2) He also continues to have convulsive seizures, with his most recent one occurring on April 13, 2015. This involved stiffening, shaking, blue lips, and took 2 hours to recover from.

3) There is no mention of him being on any anti-seizure medication currently or having trialed any in the past. 

4) The conclusion states "I advise that Mr. Jones has an anti-epileptic medication long term" and lamotrigine is being newly started, indicating his seizures have been uncontrolled up until this point.

5) No appreciable change in his seizure frequency, severity or recovery is documented. He continues to have both focal aware and impaired awareness seizures as well as convulsive seizures.

Therefore, without any worthwhile improvement or reduction in seizures, an Engel score of IVB - no appreciable change, is most appropriate here. Starting an antiseizure medication does not itself equal improvement in seizures. Please let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
