Engel Score: IIB

Explanation: Based on the information provided, Mr. Rowlands has rare disabling seizures since starting levetiracetam after his seizure cluster in February. The clinical note states that he has had no convulsive seizures since being started on levetiracetam, but he has been experiencing focal seizures with altered awareness described as "blank episodes" where he stares blankly for a couple minutes. These would be considered disabling seizures. Since he has rare disabling focal seizures since beginning treatment, but no convulsive seizures, this would meet criteria for Engel class IIB - rare disabling seizures since surgery (or in this case, since beginning levetiracetam treatment). The seizures are not frequent enough to qualify for a higher Engel class of continuing disabling seizures. However, he also does not qualify for a lower, more favorable Engel score since he is not completely seizure-free. Therefore, based on the available information, I have assigned an Engel score of IIB.
