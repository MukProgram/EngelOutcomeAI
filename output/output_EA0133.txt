Engel Score: IIB

Explanation: Based on the clinical note, Mr. Harris has focal motor seizures affecting his left arm occurring 2-3 times per month. He also had a focal to bilateral convulsive seizure in 2015. This indicates he has rare disabling seizures since the onset of his epilepsy. Specifically, the focal motor seizures are not considered disabling, but the convulsive seizure in 2015 would be considered disabling. He has not been free of disabling seizures since onset, but they are described as rare. Therefore, an Engel score of IIB ("Rare disabling seizures since surgery") best fits his current seizure status. The other Engel score options do not accurately reflect his situation - he has more than rare disabling seizures, ruling out IIA, IIC, and IID. He also does not have prolonged seizure-free intervals amounting to greater than half the follow-up period, ruling out IIIB. While he has had a worthwhile reduction in focal motor seizures with medication, he still has rare disabling convulsive seizures, ruling out IIIA. The provided details do not support assigning a class IV score. Therefore, IIB is the most accurate Engel score based on the information provided.
