Engel Score: IIB

Explanation: Based on the information provided in the clinical note, the patient has had rare disabling seizures since his traumatic brain injury in 2005. Specifically, it states that he had focal to bilateral convulsive seizures in October 2019, which caused loss of consciousness and required hospitalization. This appears to be the first documented seizure since his accident 14 years prior. Having a single documented disabling seizure in 14 years would qualify as "rare disabling seizures since surgery" under the Engel scale, meeting criteria for score IIB. While the patient did not actually undergo epilepsy surgery, the Engel scale is still applicable for rating seizure control in this case. The note does not provide enough information to determine if the patient has had any additional disabling seizures in the past 14 years that were undocumented. However, given the long interval, score IIB seems most appropriate based on the available information. In summary, rare documented disabling seizures over a timespan greater than 10 years aligns with an Engel score of IIB.
