Engel Score: IVB

Explanation: Based on the information provided in the clinical note, the patient continues to have complex partial seizures, described as episodes starting with butterflies in her stomach followed by darkness, occurring about once every 3 weeks despite being on antiepileptic medication (lamotrigine 150mg twice daily). There is no mention of any appreciable change or worthwhile improvement in her seizure frequency or severity compared to her baseline prior to starting medication. While her EEG showed only minor temporal slowing and was described as otherwise normal, her seizures have not been controlled. She misses some doses of her medication, indicating suboptimal compliance, but there is no mention that her seizures worsened after starting medication. Therefore, based on the Engel criteria of "No appreciable change" in seizure frequency/severity, I have assigned this patient a score of IVB. The information provided does not clearly fit into any other Engel class. The lack of comparison to a pre-treatment baseline seizure frequency, surgery, or details on response to medication changes makes definitively assigning an Engel score difficult, but IVB appears most accurate based on the details provided. Please let me know if you need any clarification or have additional information to share regarding this patient's seizure outcomes.
