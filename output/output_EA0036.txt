Engel Score: IVA

Explanation: Based on the information provided, the patient has long-standing epilepsy with generalized tonic-clonic seizures that generally last 1 minute. She has been on sodium valproate for 10 years but continues to have breakthrough seizures. There is no mention of her being seizure-free for any period of time. The neurologist suggests increasing her sodium valproate dose, implying that her seizures are not well-controlled on her current dose. She would fall into Engel class IV - No worthwhile improvement, specifically subclass IVA - Significant seizure reduction. While it is not explicitly stated, it seems her current medication provides some seizure control but not to the point of seizure freedom or worthwhile improvement, hence the suggested dose increase. Without more information it is difficult to definitively classify her, but class IVA seems most applicable based on the details provided.
