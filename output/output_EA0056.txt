Engel Score: III

Explanation:

Based on the clinical note provided, the patient appears to have two distinct seizure types:

1. Partial motor seizures involving left arm twitching with retained awareness, occurring monthly. These are likely related to his previous cerebral abscess and subsequent epilepsy surgery.

2. Non-epileptic psychogenic seizures (PNES), characterized by eye closure, tremor-like movements of the arms, and no EEG changes during an event. These PNES episodes are brought on by stress and have been present for the last two years.

Given that the patient continues to experience both types of seizures, with the epileptic seizures occurring monthly and the PNES episodes occurring intermittently, he would likely be classified as Engel Class III. This class is defined as "Worthwhile improvement" with a reduction in seizure frequency, but not seizure-free.

The clinical reasoning for this classification is as follows:

1. The patient is not seizure-free, as he continues to experience both epileptic seizures and PNES episodes.
2. However, he has experienced some improvement, as the epileptic seizures are now limited to partial motor seizures with retained awareness, and the secondary generalized seizures have been reduced to approximately one per year.
3. The PNES episodes, while not related to the epilepsy itself, still contribute to the overall seizure burden and impairment in quality of life.

Therefore, considering the persistence of both seizure types but with some improvement in frequency and severity, an Engel Score of III (Worthwhile improvement) appears to be the most appropriate classification for this patient's current condition.
