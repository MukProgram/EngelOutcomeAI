Engel Score: IIB

Explanation: Based on the information provided, the patient has rare disabling seizures since his epilepsy started 10 years ago after surgery for a brain abscess. He has partial motor seizures with left arm twitching involving retained awareness every month. He also has secondary generalized seizures about once a year, with his most recent one being on Christmas Day 2009. This fits the criteria for Engel Class IIB - rare disabling seizures since surgery. While he has additional non-epileptic psychogenic seizures, the Engel scale is meant to classify the disabling epileptic seizures. So I based the score solely on his description of the disabling partial motor and generalized tonic-clonic seizures, which occur rarely (monthly partial seizures and about yearly secondary generalized). His non-epileptic seizures are not factored into the Engel score.
