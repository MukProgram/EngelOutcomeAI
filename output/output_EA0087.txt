Engel Score: IIC

Explanation: Based on the clinical note, the patient is experiencing "more than rare disabling seizures after surgery, but rare seizures for at least 2 years." Specifically, the note states that the patient is having generalized tonic-clonic seizures about 4 times in the past 3 weeks. This indicates more than rare disabling seizures, meeting the criteria for IIC. The note does not specify if this seizure frequency has been present for at least 2 years, but there is no evidence against it. Therefore, I chose IIC as the Engel score. I considered IIIA as well since there is "worthwhile seizure reduction" in regards to the myoclonic jerks. However, the increased generalized tonic-clonic seizures point more towards IIC in my judgement. Please let me know if you disagree or have any other questions!
