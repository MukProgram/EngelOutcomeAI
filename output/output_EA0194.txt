Based on the information provided, I would assign this patient an Engel score of: 

IIB

Explanation:
The patient is described as having "focal dyscognitive seizures 2-3 per week" as well as "focal to bilateral convulsive seizures 1-2 per year." While the focal dyscognitive seizures are frequent, occurring multiple times per week, they are not described as being disabling. However, the focal to bilateral convulsive seizures, occurring 1-2 times per year, would likely be considered disabling. 

The Engel scale defines Class II as "Rare disabling seizures ('almost seizure-free')." Within this, subclass IIB is defined as "Rare disabling seizures since surgery." Although the patient did not have surgery, they seem to fit the criteria of having rare (1-2 per year) disabling seizures. The focal dyscognitive seizures are frequent but not necessarily disabling.

Therefore, based on having rare disabling convulsive seizures but more frequent non-disabling focal seizures, the patient best fits the IIB subclassification - having rare disabling seizures with worthwhile improvement but not seizure free. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
