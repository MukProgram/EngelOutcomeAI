Engel Score: IB

Explanation: Based on the information provided, the patient has not had any disabling seizures since August 2016 when she had her last generalized tonic-clonic seizure. She has had some non-disabling simple partial seizures (absences) since then, with the last absence seizure occurring in November 2016. She has now been free of disabling seizures for over 2 years. According to the Engel criteria, this would be most consistent with a Class IB designation - "Non disabling simple partial seizures only since surgery." The patient is described as having no further generalized tonic-clonic seizures, which are considered disabling, but did have some non-disabling absence seizures after August 2016. However, she has now been free of both disabling and non-disabling seizures for over 2 years, meeting criteria for Class IB. The lack of surgery in this case does not change the fact that based on the seizure history provided, her outcome most closely aligns with an Engel IB designation.
