Engel Score: IVB

Explanation: Based on the information provided, the patient does not seem to have undergone epilepsy surgery. The clinical note states that the patient has a history of around 10 unwitnessed "events" (presumed seizures/blackouts) over the past 9 months, associated with reducing his alcohol intake. He has not had any events in the past 2 weeks since maintaining his alcohol intake. There is no mention of him being on anti-seizure medications. 

Given there is no clear evidence that the patient underwent resective epilepsy surgery, we cannot accurately assign an Engel score, which evaluates outcomes specifically after epilepsy surgery. However, the note seems to imply no significant change or improvement in his events over the 9 month period, despite cutting back alcohol intake. Therefore, I assigned a score of IVB ("No appreciable change") but again want to emphasize that Engel scores are intended for postoperative seizure outcomes. Additional details on the patient's condition over time would help clarify if there has been any worthwhile improvement or worsening.
