Engel Score: IIIA

Explanation: Based on the information provided, Hannah has had a worthwhile seizure reduction after increasing her tegretol dose. Specifically, it is reported that "Increasing her tegretol has improved her seizures" and that "Hannah thinks that she has had 2 seizures in the last five months which is good for her." Even though the exact percentage reduction in seizures is not stated, going from an unspecified higher frequency to only 2 seizures in 5 months would constitute a worthwhile improvement. She is not completely seizure-free, ruling out Class I. She also does not fit into Class II ("rare disabling seizures") since 2 seizures in 5 months is more frequent than rare. Class IIIA ("Worthwhile seizure reduction") best captures her level of improvement. The note does not provide enough information to determine if she has had prolonged seizure-free intervals amounting to greater than half the follow-up period (Class IIIB), so IIIA is the best fit. Class IV would not apply since she has had more than just a significant seizure reduction. In summary, Hannah has experienced a worthwhile reduction in her seizure frequency after medication changes, meeting criteria for Engel IIIA.
