Engel Score: IA

Explanation: Based on the information provided, the patient has been completely seizure-free for at least 2 years, indicating an Engel score of IA. Specifically, it states "She does not get seizures very often and her last seizure was two years ago" and "She previously has been 10 years without seizures." Even though she does not have seizures often and they seem to be triggered by stressful situations, she has still been seizure-free for over 2 years, meeting criteria for Engel IA. The note also confirms the seizure type as generalised tonic-clonic seizures. While she is on anti-epileptic medication, this does not preclude an Engel score of IA per the classification system. In summary, the lack of any seizures for over 2 years with confirmation of seizure type merits an Engel score of IA.
