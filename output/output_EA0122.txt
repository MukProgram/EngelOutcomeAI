Engel Score: 1

Explanation and Clinical Reasoning:

Based on the clinical note provided, Mrs. Lorna Liver has a diagnosis of epilepsy with generalized tonic-clonic seizures. She is currently taking sodium valproate 400mg twice daily, which has been effective in controlling her seizures. The note mentions that her last seizure was two years ago, and she has previously been seizure-free for up to 10 years.

The Engel Epilepsy Surgery Outcome Scale is typically used to evaluate the outcome of epilepsy surgery, but in this case, we can apply it to assess the overall seizure control with medical management.

An Engel Score of 1 indicates "free of disabling seizures" or "completely seizure-free" since the last seizure was two years ago, and she has had prolonged periods of seizure freedom with the current medication regimen.

It is important to note that the Engel Scale is primarily designed for post-surgical evaluation, and its application in this case is not entirely standard. However, given the information provided, an Engel Score of 1 seems appropriate as it reflects the current level of seizure control achieved with anti-epileptic medication.
