Engel Score: IIB

Explanation: Based on the clinical note, Carys is experiencing "rare disabling seizures" since starting medication. Specifically, she is having 4 generalized tonic-clonic seizures over the past 3 weeks. This frequency of disabling seizures would be considered "rare" based on the Engel criteria. She also continues to have minor myoclonic jerks about once per week. So she fits into category IIB - "Rare disabling seizures since surgery." I chose this over other categories like IIIA because she has had a period of 5 weeks seizure free in the recent past, so this does not reach the "prolonged seizure-free intervals amounting to greater than half the follow-up period" criteria for category IIIB. The recent increase in disabling seizures also makes categories IA, IB, IC, ID not applicable here.
