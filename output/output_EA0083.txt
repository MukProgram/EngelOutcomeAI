Engel Score: IIB

Explanation: Based on the information provided in the clinical note, the patient is experiencing rare disabling seizures since starting treatment. Specifically, the note states that "More recently she has suffered stress and insomnia and there has been an increase in her seizures. She is currently having seizures on a weekly basis." Having weekly seizures would be considered rare, compared to more frequent daily or multiple seizures per day. The seizures are also disabling, described as tonic clonic with tongue biting and facial injuries. Therefore, based on the Engel scale criteria, this patient would be classified as IIB - Rare disabling seizures since surgery. I chose IIB because it best fits the details provided of rare but disabling seizures. The other Engel classifications did not accurately reflect the seizure frequency or level of impairment described. Please let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
