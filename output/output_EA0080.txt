Engel Score: IIB

Explanation: Based on the information provided, the patient is experiencing rare disabling seizures since surgery, specifically generalized tonic-clonic seizures occurring approximately once every 2 months. Even though it is not explicitly stated that the patient underwent surgery, the Engel scale criteria are still applicable for categorizing seizure frequency and severity. A seizure frequency of once every 2 months would be considered "rare" based on the Engel criteria. Since generalized tonic-clonic seizures are disabling, this fits the IIB classification of "Rare disabling seizures since surgery." The seizures are not frequent enough to qualify for a Class III designation of "Worthwhile improvement." Therefore, given the seizure frequency and type, I have assigned this patient an Engel score of IIB. Please let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
