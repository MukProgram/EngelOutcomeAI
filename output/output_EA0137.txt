Engel Score: IIC

Explanation: Based on the information provided, the patient has secondary generalized seizures that occur about 2 times per year despite being on antiepileptic medication. This frequency of disabling seizures would fall into Engel Class IIC, which is defined as "More than rare disabling seizures after surgery, but rare seizures for at least 2 years." Specifically, the patient is having about 2 disabling seizures per year, which is more than rare but has been ongoing for many years. While the patient has not actually undergone epilepsy surgery, the Engel criteria is still a useful scale to categorize the seizure frequency and severity. The recent addition of lamotrigine seems to have provided some benefit in seizure control and mood, but she continues to have disabling seizures a couple times a year. So based on seizure frequency, IIC seems most applicable.
