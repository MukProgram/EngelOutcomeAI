Engel Score: IIB

Explanation: Based on the clinical note, the patient has focal onset epilepsy and is currently taking Brivaracetam medication. It is mentioned that after switching medications, the patient feels generally better and his focal seizures now happen around once or twice per month. This frequency of disabling seizures would be consistent with a Class II Engel score, specifically IIB ("Rare disabling seizures since surgery"). Even though the patient has not undergone surgery, the Engel criteria can still reasonably be applied to classify his current seizure frequency and severity. Specifically, having rare disabling seizures since starting the new medication puts him in the IIB category based on the scale definitions. The seizures are still disabling, though less frequent. Class III would not apply since he does not have prolonged seizure-free intervals greater than half the follow-up period. And Class I is not applicable since he is not seizure-free. So based on having rare disabling seizures since changing medications, but not being seizure-free, Class IIB Engel score seems most appropriate.
