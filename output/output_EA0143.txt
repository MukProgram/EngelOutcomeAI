Engel Score: IC

Explanation: Based on the information provided, Ms. Jenkins was initially free of disabling seizures on lamotrigine treatment after her diagnosis and rare focal seizures with altered awareness for several years. However, she has been completely seizure-free for over 5 years now. Though she recently stopped taking lamotrigine on her own 2 months ago, she continues to remain seizure-free. Therefore, she fits the criteria for Engel class IC - "Some disabling seizures after surgery, but free of disabling seizures for at least 2 years." The timeline indicates she had some disabling focal seizures after initial treatment, but has now been free of disabling seizures for over 5 years, which satisfies the IC criteria. The fact she is not post-surgery is irrelevant per the instructions. Her seizure control and timeline most closely aligns to Engel class IC based on the scale definitions provided.
