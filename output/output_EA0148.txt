Engel Score: IIIA

Explanation: Based on the information provided in the clinical note, the patient has had a worthwhile seizure reduction, but it is difficult to definitively classify him into one of the other Engel score categories since he does not have post-surgical follow-up and duration of seizures is not clearly specified. He has had 2 witnessed disabling seizures that caused post-ictal confusion and disorientation. He also has staring spells of unclear nature. He has been started on an anti-epileptic drug (sodium valproate) which will hopefully lead to worthwhile seizure reduction, though the clinical note does not provide information to make a definitive assessment of this. He does not yet fit into Class I (free of disabling seizures) or Class II (rare disabling seizures) since he has had 2 definite disabling seizures recently. There is also no prolonged seizure-free intervals over 2 years to qualify him for Class IIIB. So based on the information provided, IIIA for worthwhile seizure reduction seems the most applicable Engel score. However, this assessment may change over time depending on his response to medication and the further workup with MRI and EEG. Please let me know if you need any clarification or have additional information to add.
