Engel Score: IIIB

Explanation: Based on the information provided in the clinical note, the patient has a diagnosis of juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME) and is currently being treated with the anticonvulsant medication sodium valproate (epilim). 

The note states that the patient initially had a good response to epilim, but recently has had increasing seizures, prompting the referral and medication restart. There are no details provided on the specific seizure frequency before and after the medication restart. However, the fact that she had a good initial response suggests worthwhile improvement in seizures at one point (Engel class III). 

The note also states that she stopped taking epilepsy medication during her first pregnancy 15 years ago. This suggests she had a prolonged seizure-free period off medications in the past, but it is unclear if this was greater than 2 years. 

Given the lack of clear information on the patient's seizure frequency and duration of seizure-freedom at different time points, I chose Engel score IIIB based on the history of worthwhile seizure improvement on medications in the past, and prolonged seizure-free intervals off medications, even though the exact duration is not provided. However, if more details were available, a different Engel score could be justified. Please let me know if you need any clarification or have additional information to share regarding my choice.
