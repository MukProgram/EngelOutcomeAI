Based on the information provided, I would assign this patient an Engel score of: 

IVB

Explanation:
The Engel Outcome Scale is typically used to classify seizure outcomes after epilepsy surgery. However, this patient did not undergo epilepsy surgery. She had a mild subarachnoid hemorrhage 12 years ago and continues to experience a combination of epileptic and nonepileptic seizures. 

She is currently taking two antiepileptic medications - Tegretol and levetiracetam. The note states "I have made no changes to her treatment." This indicates there has likely been no appreciable change or difference in her seizures over recent follow-up.

Given there is no mention of the patient having undergone resective epilepsy surgery and her medications have remained unchanged, suggesting no significant improvement or worsening of seizures, I assigned a score of IVB. An IVB score indicates "No appreciable change" which aligns with the information provided about this patient's seizure frequency and treatment. However, this scale wasn't designed for non-surgical patients so applying it here has limitations. I would be happy to provide any further explanation or clarification of my reasoning.
