Engel Score: IB

Explanation: Based on the information provided in the clinical note, the patient Steffan is experiencing "non disabling simple partial seizures only since surgery". Specifically, the note states that he has "one to two episodes most days, shortly after he has got up but none otherwise". This indicates that he is having some seizures, but they are not described as disabling. Therefore, an Engel score of IB ("Non disabling simple partial seizures only since surgery") seems most appropriate. The other Engel scores do not accurately reflect Steffan's current seizure status as described in the note. While the note does say he is not actually post-surgery, the Engel scale still seems the best way to categorize his seizure frequency and severity based on the criteria provided. The IB score indicates he has some ongoing non-disabling seizures, which aligns with having one to two episodes most days that are not further described as disabling.
