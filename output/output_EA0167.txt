Engel Score: IIA

Explanation: Based on the clinical note, the patient is experiencing rare disabling seizures since he has had around 5 seizures in the last year. This fits the criteria for Class IIA on the Engel scale - "Initially free of disabling seizures but has rare seizures now." Even though it does not state he was initially free of seizures after surgery, given his symptomatic epilepsy and the description of his current seizure frequency, Class IIA appears to be the best fit. Specifically, he is having focal seizures with altered awareness about 5 times per year, which could be considered rare disabling seizures. The note also states his seizures are "relatively stable", further supporting that he is having rare continuing seizures. While a worthwhile reduction (Class IIIA) could also be applicable, his seizures do not appear frequent enough to qualify for this. In summary, the seizures are relatively well-controlled but he continues to have rare disabling events, best meeting Class IIA criteria.
