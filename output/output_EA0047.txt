Based on the information provided, I would assign this patient an Engel score of IVB. 

Explanation:
The patient is experiencing generalized convulsive seizures once per week as well as absence seizures and myoclonic jerks several times per day. There is no mention of any seizure freedom, even brief periods, since starting treatment. The clinical note states that "Her seizures remain uncontrolled." This indicates there has been no worthwhile improvement or appreciable change in seizure frequency with current treatment. Therefore, an Engel score of IVB (No appreciable change) is most appropriate. While a case could be made for IVB or IVC (Seizures worse), there is no clear evidence her seizures have worsened. The note simply states they remain uncontrolled on her current medications. Without more details, IVB seems to best capture her current level of seizure control.
