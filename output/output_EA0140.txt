Engel Score: IIB

Explanation: Based on the information provided, the patient has rare disabling seizures since the onset of her epilepsy. Specifically, it states that she gets a focal to bilateral convulsive seizure around once every two months. These seizures cause impairment, as evidenced by the fact that she is not currently working. Therefore, her seizures meet the criteria for Class II on the Engel scale - rare disabling seizures ("almost seizure-free"). Within Class II, subclass IIB best fits her situation - rare disabling seizures since the onset of epilepsy. While she has not had surgery, which is what the Engel scale was designed for, this subclass fits the description of her current seizure frequency and disability level. The note does not provide enough information to determine if she has had any prolonged seizure-free intervals, only that she consistently has a seizure every couple of months. So IIB, indicating rare disabling seizures since the initial onset, most closely aligns with the details provided.
