Engel Score: IIC

Explanation: Based on the information provided, Mrs. Lorenzo has had some disabling seizures after surgery, but has been free of disabling seizures for at least 2 years. Specifically, it states she was diagnosed with epilepsy at age 36 and started on phenytoin, which was switched to levetiracetam 2 years ago. She currently takes 750mg of levetiracetam twice daily and her last seizure was 2 years ago. This history fits the criteria for Engel class IIC - "More than rare disabling seizures after surgery, but rare seizures for at least 2 years." Even though she did not actually undergo epilepsy surgery, the prompt stated to ignore that fact and assign a score based solely on the seizure history provided. Her history shows more than rare disabling seizures initially after being diagnosed and starting medication, but she has now been seizure-free for 2 years on her current regimen of levetiracetam. Therefore, I classified her as Engel IIC.
