Engel Score: 2

Explanation:
Based on the clinical note, Mrs. Sylvia Lorenzo is a 52-year-old woman with a history of epilepsy secondary to a previous subarachnoid hemorrhage due to a ruptured aneurysm at the age of 32. She has been taking levetiracetam 750mg twice daily, and her last seizure was two years ago.

The Engel Epilepsy Surgery Outcome Scale is typically used to assess the outcome of epilepsy surgery, but in this case, we can apply it to evaluate the patient's current seizure control with medication.

Since the clinical note states that her last seizure was two years ago, and she is currently experiencing side effects (irritability and mood changes) from her current medication, levetiracetam, an Engel score of 2 seems appropriate. This score indicates that the patient has experienced rare disabling seizures since the last intervention (in this case, medication).

Clinical Reasoning:
1. The patient has not been seizure-free since starting levetiracetam, as she had a seizure two years ago.
2. The side effects of levetiracetam, such as irritability and mood changes, are impacting her quality of life.
3. The clinician suggests switching to brivetiracetam, which may improve seizure control and reduce side effects.

While an Engel score of 1 (seizure-free) would be ideal, the recent seizure two years ago and the ongoing side effects suggest that her seizure control is not optimal. Therefore, an Engel score of 2, indicating rare disabling seizures, seems to be the most appropriate choice based on the information provided in the clinical note.
