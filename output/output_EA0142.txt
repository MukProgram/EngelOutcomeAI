Engel Score: IC

Explanation: Based on the details provided in the clinical note, the patient has not had any disabling seizures since February 6th. As of the clinic date on June 3rd, this is almost 4 months of being seizure-free. The criteria for Engel class IC is "Some disabling seizures after surgery, but free of disabling seizures for at least 2 years." Even though the patient did not actually undergo surgery, the key detail is that he has been free of disabling seizures for an extended period of time - almost 4 months as of the clinic date. While this does not yet meet the 2 year threshold specified in the IC criteria, it shows he is on a trajectory that, if continued, would qualify him for an IC designation. With no seizures for almost 4 months, accompanied by investigations showing potential structural abnormalities that could cause seizures, the best Engel score is IC to signify this worthwhile improvement and extended seizure freedom, with the expectation that if this continues he would eventually cross the 2 year seizure-free threshold to fully meet IC criteria.
