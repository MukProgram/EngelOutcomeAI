Engel Score: IIB

Explanation: Based on the information provided, Rachel continues to have rare disabling seizures since surgery (she has not had surgery, but for the purposes of assigning an Engel score we can consider her current treatment regimen as equivalent). Specifically, it is mentioned that she has recently had a "further cluster of complex partial seizures", indicating that she does still experience some disabling seizures, though they seem to be relatively well-controlled overall with medications. The note also mentions there are plans to potentially withdraw one of her medications (Levetiracetam) if she remains seizure-free, further suggesting the disabling seizures are not fully controlled but happen only rarely at this point. Given this, Class IIB - "Rare disabling seizures since surgery" - seems most applicable. The rationale is that she continues to have some breakthrough disabling seizures, but they are described as happening in "clusters" and requiring hospital admission, indicating they do not occur very frequently. So while not seizure-free, the seizures appear to be relatively rare.
