Engel Score: IIB

Explanation: Based on the information provided, the patient has rare disabling seizures since starting new medication (lamotrigine). Specifically, it states "Since the last consultation you have started him on lamotrigine, and this has helped his seizures." This indicates that the addition of lamotrigine has reduced the frequency of disabling seizures, but the patient still experiences rare disabling seizures. The clinical note also documents "three or four further episodes" of seizures characterized by staring, falls, and tongue biting. While the seizures are less frequent due to the medication change, the patient still experiences rare disabling seizures, meeting criteria for Engel IIB. The seizures are not frequent enough to qualify for IIC, there is no mention of nocturnal only seizures to qualify for IID, and there is not enough information to determine if there has been a worthwhile improvement to qualify for Class III. Therefore, based on the rare ongoing disabling seizures after medication change, I have assigned this patient an Engel score of IIB.
