Engel Score: IIB

Explanation: Based on the information provided in the clinical note, the patient is experiencing rare disabling seizures since starting treatment. Specifically, the note states that she is still getting "fairly frequent seizures", about 1 seizure per week to 1 seizure per month. While not explicitly stated, these seizures appear to be disabling based on the description that she "loses time" during the seizures. She has been on anti-epileptic medication but continues to experience seizures, though less frequently than prior to treatment. This fits the criteria for Engel score IIB - "Rare disabling seizures since surgery." Though the patient did not actually undergo surgery, she has been on medication therapy which has provided some improvement but not complete seizure control. The seizures occur rarely but are still disabling. Hence, Engel score IIB seems most applicable.
