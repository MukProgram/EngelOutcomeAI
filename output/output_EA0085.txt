Engel Score: IIB

Explanation: Based on the information provided in the clinical note, the patient appears to have rare disabling seizures since the presumed diagnosis of juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. Specifically, the note states that since age 17 (4 years ago), the patient has had on average one seizure per year, but had 3 seizures in 2020. This indicates that the patient has disabling generalized tonic-clonic seizures, but they occur infrequently, consistent with an Engel score of IIB (Rare disabling seizures since surgery). Although the timeline is not clearly postoperative, the frequency and severity of seizures match the IIB criteria. The myoclonic jerks are described as non-disabling. So while the patient does appear to have worthwhile improvement in seizure control, the continuing occurrence of disabling generalized seizures, though rare, warrants an Engel score of IIB. If more follow-up information showed no further disabling seizures for at least 2 years, the score could be upgraded to IIC. But with the information given, IIB seems most accurate.
