Based on the information provided, I would assign this patient an Engel score of:

Engel IIB

Explanation:
The patient is described as having "generalised tonic clonic seizures, 1 since previous appointment" as well as "myoclonic jerks weekly" and "occasional absences." This indicates that the patient is still experiencing disabling seizures, though they seem to be rare based on having only 1 generalized tonic clonic seizure since the previous appointment. Rare disabling seizures since an intervention categorizes the patient as Engel IIB. While the patient has seen worthwhile improvements with reductions in seizures since medication changes, they are still experiencing disabling seizures even if infrequently. Therefore, Engel IIB appears to be the most appropriate classification based on the outcome scale criteria. The clinical note does not provide enough information to determine specific time intervals to further classify based on years seizure free. However, the description of rare disabling seizures is most consistent with an Engel IIB classification. Please let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
