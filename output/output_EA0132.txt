Engel Score: IIA

Explanation: Based on the clinical note, Mr. Hanson has been experiencing focal seizures with altered awareness several times per month. He had one focal to bilateral convulsive seizure in the past. He has not had surgery, so he does not fit into the typical Engel scale categories which evaluate outcomes after epilepsy surgery. However, category IIA - "Initially free of disabling seizures but has rare seizures now" - seems to best match his current situation of continuing to have some disabling seizures, though not as frequently as in the past. He is not seizure free, but has seen a worthwhile reduction in seizures. So while the Engel scale is not a perfect fit without the surgery context, category IIA indicates he has seen improvement in seizures but still experiences some disabling events, aligning with the clinical details provided. Please let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
