Engel Score: IIB

Explanation: Based on the information provided, the patient has experienced rare disabling seizures since the presumed onset of epilepsy at age 15. Specifically, she has experienced 4 total seizures over the past 4 years, which equates to around 1 seizure per year. These seizures involve loss of consciousness and tonic-clonic movements, indicating they are disabling. Since the seizures are not more frequent than rare and have occurred since the presumed onset of the epilepsy, a classification of IIB ("Rare disabling seizures since surgery") seems most appropriate. An argument could be made for IIA ("Initially free of disabling seizures but has rare seizures now") given the first seizure did not occur until age 15. However, there is no clear "post-operative" period in this clinical vignette, so IIB seems most fitting. The seizures are not frequent enough to warrant a class III designation, and there has been no reduction or worsening to warrant class IV. So in summary, the rare but consistent disabling seizures since presumed onset at age 15 best fits class IIB based on the information provided.
