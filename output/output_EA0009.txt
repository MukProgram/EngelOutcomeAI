Based on the information provided, I would assign this patient an Engel score of IVB - No appreciable change.

Explanation:
The patient is described as having ongoing seizures since 4 weeks after her brain surgery. The seizures involve a left-handed stiffness progressing to her shoulder, with loss of consciousness and bilateral convulsive activity occurring about 50% of the time. Her current seizure frequency is 2-4 seizures per month, although she did have a 3-week period where seizure frequency increased to 6-9 seizures per week. 

She is taking two anti-epileptic medications, levetiracetam and lamotrigine, but continues to have breakthrough seizures. The neurologist suggests increasing the lamotrigine dose, implying that her seizures are not adequately controlled on her current medication regimen.

Overall, this history demonstrates that the patient has had no appreciable reduction in seizure frequency or severity since her surgery. Her seizure control has not significantly improved. This meets criteria for Engel class IVB - no appreciable change. Although she does not have worsening seizures (class IVC), she also does not have a significant seizure reduction or even prolonged seizure-free intervals (class IIIB or IVB). Her lack of response to medications also suggests no worthwhile improvement. Therefore, class IVB most accurately reflects her outcome based on the Engel scale criteria.
