Engel Score: IVB

Explanation: Based on the information provided in the clinical note, Tom is experiencing 1-2 seizures per day despite being on two antiepileptic medications (carbamazepine and levetiracetam). His partner also reports that he has become more irritable and aggressive recently, which the clinician attributes to the levetiracetam. 

The clinician plans to switch the levetiracetam to brivaracetam and add clobazam, with the goal of better seizure control and improved behavior. However, no actual outcome data is provided to indicate whether these medication changes led to any improvement. 

Without clear evidence of worthwhile seizure reduction or prolonged seizure freedom, Tom's condition at the time of this clinical note best fits into Engel class IVB - "No appreciable change" in seizure control. He continues to have frequent daily disabling seizures, despite antiepileptic drug treatment. The planned medication changes suggest an attempt to improve his impairment, but the note does not confirm any actual improvement by the time of this documentation. Hence, class IVB appears to be the most accurate designation based on the information given.
