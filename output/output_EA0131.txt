Engel Score: IVB

Explanation: Based on the information provided, the patient has no appreciable change in her seizure control or frequency compared to her baseline prior to any interventions mentioned. Specifically, it states that "Unfortunately seizures have been worse in the last year" and she is having frequent generalized tonic-clonic seizures. The note also mentions that switching to sodium valproate initially provided better seizure control, but this effect has worn off over time. There is no mention of any surgical intervention or definitive period of seizure freedom in the note. Therefore, I have assigned an Engel score of IVB - no appreciable change. I chose this over other Class IV scores because there is not enough information to determine if there has been any significant seizure reduction (IVA) or definitive worsening of seizures (IVC) compared to her baseline. The note suggests ongoing struggles with uncontrolled seizures with no sustained improvements, warranting the IVB designation. Please let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
