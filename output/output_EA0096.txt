Engel Score: IIIA

Explanation: Based on the information provided in the clinical note, it seems that the patient has had a worthwhile seizure reduction, but not necessarily prolonged seizure-free intervals greater than 2 years or seizure freedom. Specifically, the note states that his seizure control has been "variable" but his mother thought it was overall "good" until about a week ago when it began to slip. Earlier that week he had some generalized tonic-clonic seizures at night and frequent drop attacks and absences during the day. However, on the day of the appointment, he was described as walking steadily, not dribbling, with no overt seizures seen. 

So while he has had a recent increase in seizure frequency and severity, he does still seem to have an overall worthwhile reduction compared to his baseline. But there is no indication he has been seizure-free for at least 2 years or has had prolonged seizure-free intervals making up the majority of the follow-up period. Therefore, I have assigned an Engel score of IIIA to indicate worthwhile seizure reduction but not seizure freedom. I made this determination based on weighing the full clinical context provided rather than just the most recent seizure activity. Please let me know if you need any clarification or have a different interpretation of the appropriate Engel score here.
