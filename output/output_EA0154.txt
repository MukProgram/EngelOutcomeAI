Based on the information provided, I would assign this patient an Engel score of:

IIB

Explanation:
The patient is described as having epilepsy with focal onset seizures occurring approximately every 4 weeks currently. She is on lamotrigine which has helped her recover after seizures, but she continues to have breakthrough disabling seizures around once a month. This fits the criteria for Engel IIB - "Rare disabling seizures since surgery." Even though the patient did not actually undergo epilepsy surgery, the Engel scale is still commonly used to categorize seizure outcomes in patients with epilepsy regardless of treatment. A seizure frequency of once every 4 weeks would be considered rare disabling seizures. More frequent disabling seizures would fall into category IIC, while less frequent seizures would potentially qualify as IIA. But based on the information given, IIB seems most applicable. The lamotrigine has provided some benefit in shortening her post-ictal recovery, but she continues to experience rare disabling focal onset seizures around once a month despite treatment. So I assigned a score of IIB. Please let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
