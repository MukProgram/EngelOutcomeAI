Engel Score: ID

Explanation: Based on the information provided, I chose an Engel score of ID for this patient. The key piece of information is that the patient has had no further seizures since her last visit. This indicates she has been free of disabling seizures for at least the 6 month period since her last appointment. 

While she does not have a history of epilepsy surgery, which is typically required for assigning an Engel score, the criteria still provide a useful framework. An ID classification means the patient has had generalized convulsions but only in the context of antiepileptic drug withdrawal. Since this patient is not on any anti-epileptic drugs, this category best fits her situation of being seizure-free without medications.

The other Engel scores do not accurately reflect her lack of seizures over the follow-up period while not taking any anti-seizure medications. However, if she were to have another seizure, she would no longer meet the ID criteria. I made this determination to the best of my ability based on the details provided. Please let me know if you need any clarification or have additional information to add.
