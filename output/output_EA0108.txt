Engel Score: IVB

Explanation: Based on the information provided in the clinical note, the patient is experiencing 2-3 seizures per month despite being on anti-epileptic medication. The note states that his seizures had been well controlled until December 2022 when he had a breakthrough seizure while walking. Since then, he has been having seizures 2-3 times per month consisting of focal onset with secondary generalization. He recently had an injury during a seizure indicating they are still disabling. While there has been a change in his seizure frequency and control, he continues to have frequent disabling seizures on medications. Therefore, I have assigned him an Engel score of IVB - indicating no appreciable change or worthwhile improvement in his epilepsy. Although there is potential to adjust medications to try to improve control, based on his current state as described, class IVB fits best. The other classes imply worthwhile improvements or complete freedom from disabling seizures which is not the case here where he continues to have frequent disabling events. Please let me know if you need any clarification or have a different interpretation of the Engel score for this patient based on the note. I'm happy to discuss further.
