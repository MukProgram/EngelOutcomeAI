Based on the clinical note provided, I will assign an Engel score of IVA - Significant seizure reduction. 

Explanation:
The Engel Outcome Scale is typically used to classify seizure outcomes following epilepsy surgery. However, this patient has not undergone epilepsy surgery. The note states that the patient continues to have "occasional seizures" while on two anti-epileptic medications, Keppra and Zonisamide. It also says "Epilepsy is about the same." This suggests there has not been a major change or worthwhile improvement in seizure frequency. However, the fact that she continues to have occasional seizures while on medications, rather than more frequent seizures, could be considered a significant seizure reduction compared to her baseline prior to medication treatment. Without more details on her specific seizure frequency over time, I do not have enough information to assign a more specific Engel class. But "occasional seizures" on medications suggests some amount of seizure reduction, so I assigned a class of IVA. If further details on the patient's seizure frequency, response to medications over time, or prior to treatment baseline were provided, I could potentially revise the Engel score and provide an updated explanation. But with the limited information given, IVA seems most appropriate.
