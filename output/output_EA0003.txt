Engel Score: IIB

Explanation: Based on the information provided, the patient is experiencing "rare disabling seizures" since the apparent reemergence of her epilepsy about 5 years ago. Specifically, it is stated that she continues to have generalized seizures every few months. Having seizures every 2 months (6 seizures per year) would be considered "rare" based on typical definitions. These seizures are also disabling, as she has injured herself, bitten her tongue, and is unable to drive due to them. She has this pattern of rare disabling seizures for the past 5 years. Therefore, an Engel score of IIB ("Rare disabling seizures since surgery") most closely matches her situation. The fact that she has not actually undergone surgery is irrelevant for determining the Engel score based on the seizure frequency and characteristics described. The score is meant to categorize the level of seizure control, regardless of whether surgery was performed. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
