Engel Score: IIB

Explanation: Based on the information provided, the patient is experiencing rare disabling seizures since the presumed surgery. Specifically, the note states that the patient started noticing jerky arm movements (myoclonic seizures) at age 13, which sometimes caused her to drop things. These would be considered disabling seizures. There is no mention of her undergoing surgery or becoming seizure-free for any period of time. Therefore, she appears to fit into category IIB - rare disabling seizures since surgery. I chose this over other categories such as IIIA (worthwhile seizure reduction) or IVB (no appreciable change) since there is no mention of any change in seizure frequency over time. She appears to continue to have rare disabling myoclonic seizures currently at age 20, meeting criteria for IIB.
