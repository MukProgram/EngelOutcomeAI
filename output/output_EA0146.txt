Engel Score: IVB

Explanation: Based on the information provided, the patient is experiencing multiple different types of seizures, some of which appear to be epileptic ("grand mal" seizures) and some of which appear to be dissociative (the "mini shakes"). He is having frequent seizures of both types, with around 6 "grand mal" seizures over the past year as well as multiple "mini shakes" every month. His medications do not appear to be providing adequate seizure control. 

While there is some uncertainty without more definitive diagnostic testing, given the information provided, this would seem to best fit into Engel class IVB - "No appreciable change" in seizure frequency or severity. He continues to have frequent disabling seizures of multiple types, with no clear sustained periods of seizure freedom over the past year. The addition of new antiseizure medications has not led to seizure freedom either.

In summary, based on the information provided regarding his ongoing seizure frequency and lack of significant improvement, the Engel score that best fits is IVB. Please let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
