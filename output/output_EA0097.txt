Based on the information provided in the clinical note, I have assigned an Engel score of IVB (No worthwhile improvement; No appreciable change) to this patient. 

Explanation:
The Engel Outcome Scale is typically used to classify seizure outcomes following epilepsy surgery. However, this patient has not undergone epilepsy surgery. The note states that the patient continues to experience loss of consciousness events that are likely epileptic seizures. His wife has witnessed several seizure events involving right arm stiffening, collapse, shaking, and unusual noises lasting several minutes. 

Since there is no mention of the patient having undergone epilepsy surgery, and he continues to experience disabling seizures, there is no evidence of any worthwhile improvement or appreciable change in his seizures. Therefore, an Engel score of IVB (No worthwhile improvement; No appreciable change) seems most appropriate. This indicates his seizures have not significantly changed and he has not benefited from any interventions aimed at improving seizure control.

In summary, without any surgical or therapeutic intervention noted and with continued disabling seizures described, a classification of IVB appears fitting based on the details provided. Please let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
