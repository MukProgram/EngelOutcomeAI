Engel Score: IVB

Explanation: Based on the information provided in the clinical note, the patient is experiencing significant ongoing seizures despite trials of multiple anti-epileptic drugs. Specifically, the note states that the patient "continues to get frequent seizures which are only really relieved by the midazolam" and that his "most troubling type of seizure at the moment are focal seizures with altered awareness" that "can occur in clusters very frequently." While the exact frequency is not specified, the description of "very frequent" focal seizures with alterations in awareness indicates continued disabling seizures. Additionally, the patient experiences focal to bilateral convulsive seizures up to 2-3 times per month. 

Given there is no mention of any prolonged seizure-free periods and the overall impression is of frequent ongoing disabling seizures of multiple types, I have assigned this patient an Engel score of IVB - "No appreciable change" in seizure control. While there may be some response to midazolam for aborting seizure clusters, this does not constitute a worthwhile improvement in seizure control (Class III) as the patient continues to experience disabling seizures in between midazolam doses. The information provided does not clearly document a significant reduction in seizure frequency, though there is also no evidence seizures are worse (Class IVC). Therefore, Class IVB - "No appreciable change" - most accurately captures this patient's level of seizure control based on the details provided.
