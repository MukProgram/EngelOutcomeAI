Engel Score: IA

Explanation: Based on the clinical note, Miss Clarke has been completely seizure-free since starting lamotrigine treatment and has not had any seizures since her last clinic appointment. The note states "I was pleased to hear that she has not had any further seizures since her last clinic appointment and since starting the lamotrigine." This indicates she has been seizure-free since initiating treatment with lamotrigine. Even though a timeframe is not explicitly stated, the lack of any reported seizures and the statement about planning to learn to drive after being seizure-free for one year suggests sustained seizure freedom consistent with an Engel class IA designation of "Completely seizure-free since surgery." Though surgery was not performed, the sustained seizure freedom matches criteria for IA.
