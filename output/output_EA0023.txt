Based on the information provided, I would assign this patient an Engel score of IVB - No appreciable change.

Explanation:
The Engel Outcome Scale is typically used to classify seizure outcomes after epilepsy surgery. This patient has not undergone epilepsy surgery. However, the scale can still be applied to categorize his current seizure status. 

The patient is experiencing recurrent disabling seizures characterized by sudden loss of consciousness, tongue biting, shaking, and postictal fatigue and muscle pain. He is having these seizures frequently, around 7 times since the beginning of the year. This indicates he is having more than rare disabling seizures and there has been no worthwhile seizure reduction. 

He does not meet criteria for Class I (free of disabling seizures), Class II (rare disabling seizures), or Class III (worthwhile seizure reduction). Therefore, he would be categorized as Class IV - No worthwhile improvement. Specifically, subclass IVB - No appreciable change, since there is no documentation that the seizures are better or worse, just that they are continuing to occur.

In summary, although the Engel scale is meant for post-surgical cases, I assigned this patient a score of IVB to indicate he has uncontrolled seizures with no appreciable change or improvement. My reasoning is based on his description of frequent disabling seizures with no documented change in frequency or severity over time.
