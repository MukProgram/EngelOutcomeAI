Engel Score: IA

Explanation: Based on the information provided, the patient has been completely seizure-free for over 4 years since her last reported generalised tonic clonic seizure. She had previously been seizure-free for over 8 years prior to that last seizure. The Engel scale defines Class IA as "Completely seizure-free since surgery." Although the patient did not have surgery, she has been completely seizure-free for an extended period of time with no disabling seizures reported. Her good response to sodium valproate treatment has controlled her generalized seizures. Therefore, based on the prolonged seizure freedom, I assigned a classification of IA on the Engel scale. I considered IB and ID classifications initially, but she is not having simple partial or withdrawal-related seizures currently, so IA seems most applicable. Please let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions on my rationale!
