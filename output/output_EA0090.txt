Engel Score: IIB

Explanation: Based on the information provided, Nancy had a generalized tonic-clonic seizure two days before her birthday. This would be considered a rare disabling seizure since surgery. The note states that the father couldn't remember when she last had a seizure before this one. Having one seizure in over a year period would qualify as a rare disabling seizure. She is also still taking anti-epileptic medication. Therefore, I assigned Nancy an Engel score of IIB - Rare disabling seizures since surgery. Even though it does not state she had surgery, the instructions were to assign an Engel score regardless. IIB fits her situation best as having rare/infrequent disabling seizures over the follow-up period.
