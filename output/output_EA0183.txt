Engel Score: IIB

Explanation: Based on the clinical note, the patient has a diagnosis of complex partial seizures with secondary generalization. He has been on sodium valproate but in the last 2 years has developed some minor seizures with symptoms of dizziness, headache, nausea, unresponsiveness, and slight hand shaking. These seizures last no longer than 3 minutes and occur 4-5 times per year. His EEG shows sharp wave activity suggesting epileptiform abnormalities.

Although the patient has achieved good control of his generalized tonic-clonic seizures on medication, he now has rare disabling simple partial seizures, occurring about 4-5 times per year. As per the Engel scale criteria, this would classify the patient as IIB - "Rare disabling seizures since surgery." The seizures are disabling given they cause loss of awareness and unresponsiveness. And they are occurring rarely at 4-5 times per year. 

While the patient has not undergone epilepsy surgery, the Engel scale can still be applied to classify his current seizure control from antiepileptic medications. Based on the clinical details provided in the note, IIB appears to be the most accurate Engel classification. The recommendation to increase his sodium valproate dose also suggests his seizures are not fully controlled at the current dosage.
