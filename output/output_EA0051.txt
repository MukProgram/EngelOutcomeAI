Based on the information provided, I would assign this patient an Engel score of:

IIB

Explanation:
The patient is described as having "around 2-3 seizures per month" currently. This frequency of disabling seizures would fall into the Class II category of the Engel scale, indicating "rare disabling seizures" or being "almost seizure-free." 

Specifically, the IIB subclassification states "Rare disabling seizures since surgery." Although the patient has not actually undergone epilepsy surgery, the provided description most closely aligns with having rare/infrequent disabling seizures at the present time.

The other Class II subclassifications do not fit as well: 
- IIA refers to being initially seizure-free after surgery but having rare seizures now, which does not apply.  
- IIC refers to having more than rare disabling seizures currently, which does not match the description of 2-3 per month.
- IID refers to nocturnal seizures only, whereas this patient has seizures while awake/active as described.

In summary, based on having approximately 2-3 disabling seizures per month at present, the Engel score that best reflects this frequency is IIB. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
