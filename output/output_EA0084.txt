Engel Score: Ia

Explanation:
Based on the information provided in the clinical note, the patient Mr. David Northface has been completely seizure-free since starting antiepileptic medication (Brivaracetam). This meets the criteria for Engel class Ia - "Completely seizure-free since surgery." The note states "I am pleased to say that he has been seizure free since starting antiepileptic medication." Even though the patient did not actually undergo epilepsy surgery, he has still been completely seizure-free since the treatment with medication. So I assigned him an Engel score of Ia. The other Engel categories for a worthwhile reduction in seizures or no appreciable change do not apply here since he has had complete seizure freedom on medication. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
