Engel Score: IIIA

Explanation: Based on the clinical note, the patient has a history of myoclonic jerks and generalized tonic clonic seizures since age 13, and is currently 22 years old. She is taking sodium valproate and clobazam to manage her seizures. The note states that "Recently she has had several seizures," indicating that while on medication, she continues to experience seizures. However, there is no clear quantification of her current seizure frequency compared to baseline. 

The note also states "I would therefore not be keen to change her medication at present," implying that her medications have provided some benefit, even if not complete seizure control. Given there appears to be "Worthwhile seizure reduction" but not freedom from disabling seizures, I have assigned this patient an Engel score of IIIA based on the criteria of "Worthwhile seizure reduction." I do not have enough information to reliably assign a more specific score. Additional details on her actual seizure frequency, duration of seizure-free intervals, and response to medication adjustments would help determine if a higher or lower Engel score is warranted. Please let me know if you need any clarification or have additional information to share regarding my explanation.
