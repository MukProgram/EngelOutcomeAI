Engel Score: IVB

Explanation: Based on the information provided in the clinical note, the patient continues to have dissociative seizures about twice per week. These seizures seem to be his main issue at the moment and there is no indication that they have improved with treatment. 

The note states that he used to have focal motor seizures without changes in awareness monthly, but has not had one in around 2 years. He also previously had focal to bilateral convulsive seizures, with his last one occurring on Christmas day 2009. So he has had a reduction in his epileptic seizures, but still seems to be having some seizures and is on anti-epileptic medication.

Overall, there is no appreciable change or worthwhile improvement in his epileptic seizures, and his dissociative seizures continue frequently despite treatment. Therefore, I have assigned him an Engel score of IVB - no appreciable change. I did not assign him a score of IVC - seizures worse, since there is no evidence his seizures have become more frequent or severe compared to his baseline prior to treatment. Please let me know if you need any clarification or have a different interpretation!
