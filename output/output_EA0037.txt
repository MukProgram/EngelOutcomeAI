Based on the information provided, I do not have enough details to confidently assign an Engel score. The patient has a diagnosis of non-epileptic attack disorder and focal seizures, but there are no clear details provided on the frequency, severity or duration of the seizures before and after any treatment or surgery. Additionally, the Engel scale is meant to classify outcomes following epilepsy surgery, but this patient does not appear to have undergone epilepsy surgery based on the details given. 

Without a clear baseline seizure frequency and details on the patient's seizure control after a specific intervention like surgery, I cannot reliably apply the Engel criteria. I could guess that the patient may fall into Class III given the notation of "worthwhile seizure reduction" with medication changes, but that would be speculative without more quantitative details on the seizure frequency and severity over time.

In summary, while this clinical note provides some helpful background, there is insufficient information for me to confidently assign this patient an Engel score or to provide a detailed rationale based on the classification system criteria. More specifics would be needed regarding the patient's seizure timeline, frequency, severity, interventions, and outcomes over time. Let me know if any additional patient details can be provided.
