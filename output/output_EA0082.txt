Engel Score: IIB

Explanation: Based on the information provided, the patient is experiencing "rare disabling seizures" since starting treatment. Specifically, the note states that "the absences continue fairly frequent, he probably gets 2-3 per day" but his last generalized tonic-clonic seizure was two years ago. 

Absence seizures are considered disabling seizures. While 2-3 absence seizures per day could be considered more than "rare", the fact that he has gone 2 years without a generalized tonic-clonic seizure suggests overall decent control with "rare disabling seizures." Therefore, I have classified this patient as Engel IIB ("Rare disabling seizures since surgery").

I chose IIB over other Engel scores because:
- He is not completely seizure-free (rules out IA)
- He has disabling absence seizures, not just simple partial seizures (rules out IB) 
- He has not been seizure-free for at least 2 years (rules out IC)
- There is no mention of seizures only occurring with medication withdrawal (rules out ID)

In summary, as the patient has rare disabling absence seizures but no generalized seizures in 2 years on medications, I believe Engel IIB is the most accurate classification based on the details provided. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
