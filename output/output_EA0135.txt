Engel Score: IVB

Explanation: Based on the information provided, Mr. Francis had a 6 month period free of disabling seizures followed by a cluster of seizures over the weekend. This indicates there has been no appreciable change in his condition after the period of being seizure-free (Class IVB per Engel scale). Specifically, he is not free of disabling seizures (ruling out Class I), does not have rare disabling seizures (ruling out Class II), does not have a worthwhile seizure reduction over more than half the follow-up period (ruling out Class III), and has had no significant seizure reduction overall (ruling out Class IVA). The cluster of seizures indicates his condition has returned to baseline after the 6 month seizure-free period, with no lasting improvement, fitting the criteria for Class IVB of no appreciable change. I assigned this Engel score despite the lack of post-surgical follow-up given the instructions to provide a score anyway and explain my reasoning. Please let me know if you have any other questions!
