Engel Score: Class I

Explanation:
Based on the clinical note provided, it appears that Mr. Harry Harris has been diagnosed with dissociative seizures and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The clinician has reviewed his EEG results and observed a typical attack during the EEG without any corresponding electrographic changes, suggesting that these events are non-epileptic in nature and likely related to his dissociative seizures.

The Engel Seizure Outcome Scale is typically used to assess the outcome of epilepsy surgery, specifically the degree of seizure control achieved after the procedure. However, since Mr. Harris does not have epilepsy and has not undergone any surgical intervention, the Engel Score may not be entirely applicable in this case.

Nonetheless, considering the information provided in the clinical note, an Engel Score of Class I seems appropriate. Class I indicates "free of disabling seizures," which aligns with the clinician's statement that Mr. Harris has not had any further seizures since his last appointment.

It is important to note that the Engel Score is primarily used in the context of epilepsy surgery, and its interpretation may vary when applied to other conditions, such as dissociative seizures or PTSD. In this case, the Engel Score serves as a general indicator of the patient's current seizure status, but it does not provide a comprehensive assessment of his overall condition or treatment progress.
