Engel Score: IA

Explanation: Based on the information provided in the clinical note, there is no clear evidence that the patient has had any disabling seizures since an unspecified prior time. The note states that the patient "is very well and has had no further seizures." This suggests the patient has been completely seizure-free for some period of time. Without more details on the specific timeframe, I have assigned an Engel score of IA, which indicates completely seizure-free since surgery. However, it should be noted that the patient has not undergone surgery, so applying the Engel scale may not be completely appropriate. The lack of details on the patient's seizure history and the fact the scale is intended for post-surgical patients limits the ability to definitively assign a score. But based on the information provided, IA appears to be the best fit. Please let me know if any additional details from the clinical note suggest a different score may be more appropriate.
