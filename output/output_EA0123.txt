Engel Score: IC

Explanation:
Based on the clinical note, this patient has a diagnosis of longstanding epilepsy with generalized tonic-clonic seizures. She has been on treatment with Epilim for many years and has seen a reduction in her seizure frequency from about once per year down to one seizure every 2-3 years. Her longest seizure-free period has been 4 years while on Epilim. 

As per the Engel scale criteria:
- Class I is for patients who are free of disabling seizures
- Subcategory IC is defined as "Some disabling seizures after surgery, but free of disabling seizures for at least 2 years"

While this patient has not had surgery, she meets the criteria for Subcategory IC based on having infrequent disabling generalized tonic-clonic seizures, with seizure-free intervals of up to 4 years while on Epilim therapy. Her seizures are controlled enough to be considered "free of disabling seizures" for extensive periods of over 2 years.

Therefore, based on the clinical details provided, I have assigned this patient an Engel score of IC. Please let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
